# N. Kostin's GNU troff (groff) Templates

Here are some awesome templates that I use to write with [GNU troff (groff)](https://gnu.org/software/groff).

**Note**: Even if you already use [LaTeX](https://github.com/nkostin4/LaTeX-templates), I highly recommend learning groff; it comes with all of the extensibilty of LaTeX, but is far more lightweight and minimal.
