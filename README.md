# N. Kostin's GNU troff (groff) Templates

Here are some templates that I use to write with [GNU troff (groff)](https://gnu.org/software/groff).

**Note**: Even if one already uses [LaTeX](https://github.com/nkostin4/LaTeX-templates), it is worth learning groff; it comes with all of the extensibilty of LaTeX, but is far more lightweight and minimal.
